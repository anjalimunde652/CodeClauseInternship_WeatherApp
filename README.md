# 🌦 Weather App

A modern and responsive Weather Application that fetches and displays real-time weather information using the OpenWeather API.  
This project is developed as part of the **CodeClause Web Development Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To build a web application that allows users to fetch and view real-time weather details of any city using a weather API.
